/* 
 * This is the source code for the host.  
 * hostMain is the main function for the host.  It is an infinite
 * loop that repeatedy polls the connection from the manager and
 * its input link.  
 *
 * If there is command message from the manager,
 * it parses the message and executes the command.  This will
 * result in it sending a reply back to the manager.  
 *
 * If there is a packet on its incoming lik, it checks if
 * the packet is destined for it.  Then it stores the packet
 * in its receive packet buffer.
 *
 * There is also a 10 millisecond delay in the loop caused by
 * the system call "usleep".  This puts the host to sleep.  This
 * should reduce wasted CPU cycles.  It should also help keep
 * all nodes in the network to be working at the same rate, which
 * helps ensure no node gets too much work to do compared to others.
